In today's post we will be solving SkullNet, a CTF created by [@W4tson](https://twitter.com/W4tson_Blue) and [me](https://twitter.com/_Slayer0x), and publicly available at [DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.es/#/).

I hope you like it, looking forward to get your feedback.

## Deployment

Deploying any CTF from this platform is pretty straight forward, just navigate to [DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.es/#/) and search for  **SkullNet**, the next step will be downloading the .zip file by clicking the red download button on the right side.

Once downloaded, decompress the .zip file and you will be having the autodeploy script in combination with the SkullNet .zip container.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/files.png">
</p>

We just need to execute as root the autodeploy script followed by the skullnet.zip file and wait for the IP of the deployed container to be displayed:

</p>

Once deployed, we are ready to go!. 

(CTRL + C at any time will stop and delete the CTF from our system).

## Writeup - Initial Access

As we always do, let's start by performing some basic `nmap` recon over our target in order to discover the available services running on it:

`sudo nmap -p- --open -sS -sCV -n -Pn --min-rate 5000 172.29.0.2`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/nmap.png">
</p>

We are only capable of discovering the port 80 open, hosting an Apache 2.4.58, which doesn't have any exploits available, so let's try to access the web server using Firefox in order to inspect the site:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/firefox.png">
</p>

We are unable to access, seems like is redirecting us to `skullnet.es`, when this happens usually virtual hosting is in place, so let's try adding the `skullnet.es` domain to our local DNS resolver located at `/etc/hosts`.

You can use any editor you want, but remember saving the changes after adding the new registry:

`sudo nano /etc/hosts`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/etc.png">
</p>

If we try accessing the web server again, this time works!.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/web.png">
</p>

The "Join Now" button doesn't seem to be working and we are unable to find nothing by inspecting the source code, so the next step is performing a Subdir enumeration, trying to find sensitive files that could disclose credentials or other valid information:

`dirsearch -u http://skullnet.es/`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/dir.png">
</p>

The web server is exposing a .git directory. We cannot check each and every folder individually:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/git.png">
</p>

Instead, we can use a tool called [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools/tree/master) to dump the project:

`git clone https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools.git`

`sudo bash gitdumper.sh http://skullnet.es/.git/ SkullNet_Dump`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/gitdump.png">
</p>

Navigating to our dump folder, we will be finding the git project:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/gitdir.png">
</p>

If you are not familiarized, git is a control version software used by developers all around the globe, we can try enumerating this "versions" and try finding sensitive information that has been removed, to perform this task we can use the following command:

`git log`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/log.png">
</p>

The output shows us that there are 2 commits and we are currently at "Fix", we can try diffing our current version with the "First commit" one in order to check what changed:

`git diff 1stID 2ndID`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/diff.png">
</p>

Analysing the output, we can see that 2 files were removed.

In order to gather all the files that were removed, we need to perform a `git checkout` command, let's change to the "First commit" state:

`git checkout ID`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/checkout1.png">
</p>

As a result, we now have both removed files on our current directory:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/checkout2.png">
</p>

In the authentication.txt file, we find an interesting message in combination with credentials for the skulloperator account, the message suggests that a new authentication mechanism is being used, this is useful but not enough to guess what's going on, let's open the Wireshark dump:

`wireshark network.pcap`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/wireshark.png">
</p>

Analysis:

1. The client (Red rectangle) is performing 3 TCP SYN requests (Green rectangle) to the ports 1000, 12000 & 5000 followed by another SYN request to the port 22 (Orange rectangle) on the target IP.

2. The target IP (Blue rectangle) established the connection by sending a SYN, ACK.

We already know that the SkullNet box only has port 80 available, but our Wireshark analysis seems to unlock the port 22 by performing the first 3 SYN requests.

This protection mechanism is called [Port Knocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking), and is well documented out there, is pretty probable that the note we found was referring to this technique when talking about a "New Authentication Mechanism".

In order to perform a port knocking, we can use knock.

`apt install knockd`

`knock -v 172.29.0.2 1000 12000 5000`

After performing the port knocking, let's `nmap` our target again:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/nmapafterknock.png">
</p>

Worked!.<br />
The SSH port (22) is available now, let's connect using the credentials for the skulloperator user.

<p align="center">

</p>

Once in, we can get the user flag:

`cat user.txt`

## Writeup - Privilege Escalation

Is time to start enumerating for Privilege Escalation vectors, none of the traditional checks worked, no SUID binaries, no sudo rights, no kernel vulnerabilities...

By checking the web server path(`/var/www/skullnet.es`), we discover a python script called `skullnet_api.py` let's see what this script does:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/apicode.png">
</p>

For simplicity reasons, I divided the code in 3 parts:

1. The script starts a server on port `8081`, and looks like is using some kind of key.
2. In the second box, is checking for an `Authorization` HTTP Header and comparing the clear text value with the one stored at the`AUTH_KEY_BASE64`variable.
3. If everything is okay, and the parameter `exec` is in place, the user should be able to execute an `ls` or `whoami` command.

Let's check if the server is running:

`netstat -nat`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/netstat.png">
</p>

The python script is running!, let's interact with it using `curl`:

`curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/`

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/curl1.png">
</p>

An error message is returned as response, indicating that we need some kind of authorization, let's add the `Authorization` header according to the Python script, we will need the decoded value of the `AUTH_KEY_BASE64` variable, as the code is comparing the clear text version of it:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/curl2.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/curl3.png">
</p>

Finally, we are requested to include the `exec` parameter in order to gain code execution:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/curl4.png">
</p>

Nevertheless, we are only capable to execute `ls` and `whoami` as the server is applying restrictions, let's check back the code, in order to find any flaw that cloud allow us to bypass this filter:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/execfunc.png">
</p>

The code is using a `command.startswith` statement in order to check if the supplied argument is `ls` or `whoami`, leading to a command injection vulnerability, we can exploit this flaw by concatenating other commands making use of a simple `;`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/skullnet/curl5.png">
</p>

Awesome!, we successfully exploited the command injection vulnerability, now let's gain a privileged shell by granting skulloperator SUID privileges over the bash binary.

Remember to URL encode your payload, as we are making web requests:

1. `curl -H "Authorization: Basic we_are_bones_513546516486484" http://127.0.0.1:8081?exec=whoami%3Bchmod%20u%2Bs%20%2Fbin%2Fbash`

2. `ls -l /bin/bash`

3. `/bin/bash -p`

</p>


Don't forget to check the root.txt flag ;).
