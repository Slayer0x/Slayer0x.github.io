## About Me

I’m Héctor Ruiz Ruiz, a cybersecurity enthusiast with 3 years of professional experience in offensive security.  
Currently, I work as a Red Team Operator (specialist in pentesting and attack simulations), testing corporate systems and networks to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen their defenses.


In addition, I hold several well known certifications (OSCP, eCPPTv2, eWPT, OSWP, CARTP, CRTE, among others) that validate my technical background and my commitment to continuous improvement.

But beyond titles and achievements, what defines me is my passion for constant learning and collaboration. Cybersecurity is not just my job—it’s my vocation. I enjoy facing new challenges every day and sharing what I learn with the community.

Through this blog, I aim not only to spread knowledge and best practices but also to connect with other security enthusiasts, inspire future professionals, and highlight the human side behind the ethical hacker.

I am convinced that together we can make the digital world a safer place!
